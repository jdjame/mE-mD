"CHIRPP is a sentinel surveillance system and collects data from select emergency departments across Canada. "
"Teenagers older than 18 years of age, Aboriginal persons and people who live in rural areas may be under-represented in the eCHIRPP database, as most CHIRPP sites are paediatric hospitals located in major cities. "
"Fatal injuries are also under-represented in the eCHIRPP database because the emergency department data do not capture people who died before they could be taken to hospital or those who died after being admitted via another department."
"Information is continuously being entered into the eCHIRPP database; therefore some years do not yet have complete data."
